      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I'm a digital and media preservationist based in Chicago. My work
        centers on integrating and migrating museum and archival collections,
        building open-source data and media workflows for cultural heritage
        preservation, and preserving web-based works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm the Digital Preservation Specialist at the University of
        Chicago Library, where I contribute to
        <a href="https://node.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">UChicagoNode</a>,
        an integrated digital collections platform that brings together digital
        materials across the Library's collections. Additionally, I co-chair the
        International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Audio/Video
        Community Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I’ve worked in digital preservation, film restoration, and
        media preservation at institutions including the Asian Film Archive,
        City University of New York Television, and the J. Paul Getty Trust.
        I’ve also completed internships at Bay Area Video Coalition (BAVC),
        Cineric Inc., Internet Archive, New York Public Library (NYPL), and
        Prelinger Archives while earning my MA in Moving Image Archiving and
        Preservation (MIAP) at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.
      </p>

        Originally from sunny Singapore, I enjoy grocery shopping, sailing, and
        hiking in my free time.
